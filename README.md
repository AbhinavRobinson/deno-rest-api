## Requirements

- `Deno >1.0.0`
- `PostgreSQL`

## Runing the Code

The code still needs some work, and isn't feature complete.
If you want to try it (but I won't advice to), run `deno run --allow-net --allow-env index.js` command.

## Why Not Runnable

This is meant to be a boilerplate of functions from which you can easily reuse code. This was not meant to be run as a whole.
(also it was sort of coding practice)

## TODO

01: Reformating the Update Function in flightRepo.js
02: Reformating the Update Function in flightService.js

Additional Todos: Reformating Controllers for the former functions. You can pull, update and merge :):):):):):):)
